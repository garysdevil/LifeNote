- I am gary, graduated from Shanghai University of Electric Power two years ago.
Before my graduation, I  worked as a NodeJs backend engineer as an intern. As a backend engineer, the main job I do is communicating with frontend engineers and code restful API. Also during this period, I started to learn Linux and docker.

- After graduation, I worked for a company named WanXiang blockchainas as an SRE. During this time, I learned Kubernetes, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, and use them in working.

- From last year, I started to learn using AWS and Google Cloud when i was doing my second job. Sometimes, we,  engineers, set a goal monthly. For example, I learned the usage of Envoy for Canary Deployment once. Another example is I developed a program using Golang to collect the slow log of Amazon ElastiCache into Elasticsearch.

- Recently, I was arranged to another department to support them, cause their maintainers had gone. In this position, I make CICD by Jenkins, deploy nacos cluster, and provide materials for PFI certification, etc. 

- At the end, I want to say it's a real honor and pleasure working with you guys. Thank you!
